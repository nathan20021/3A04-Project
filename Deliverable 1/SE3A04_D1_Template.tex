\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
% Begin Section

The following document is dedicated to showcasing the requirements of the taxi carpool app requested by a local taxi company. The app is dedicated to make rides cheaper and more convenient for their riders. This app is also meant to be a long-term project for the company, meaning this \textbf{SRS} is a living document which has the possibility of changing in the future. This document will explain the important stakeholders involved, requirements and viewpoints of each while also explaining the main functions of the app.

\subsection{Purpose}
\label{sub:purpose}
% Begin SubSection
This \textbf{SRS} is meant for developers, stakeholders and direct players in the planning and development of the app and should be understandable for all those involved. This \textbf{SRS} will further break down the functionalities, constraints, use cases and overall design of the project in further detail. 

% End SubSection

\subsection{Scope}
\label{sub:scope}
% Begin SubSection
To develop this project the production of the main taxi request and offer app called TaxiCarPool, the Conversation Prompt Generator and a variety of databases will have to be produced. There will not be a need to produce a payment system into the app as this will be handled by the taxi company payment systems. The project will only project the cost of the ride but will not handle the payments as it is not part of the app’s main functionality.
\newline \newline
The TaxiCarPool app will perform the main functions of the app. This will include allowing users to request a carpool taxi, receive a list of possible rides to select and allow current rides to allow carpooling in their car. This product’s objective is to perform the main functions of matchmaking users to a carpool to save money. 
\newline \newline
The Conversation Prompt Generator will randomly generate a conversation starter for the riders to use based on their profile. Their profile will specify if they want to use this feature and if so, what they are interested in. The generator will not be forced upon any of the users and can be switched off if desired. The goal of this product is to create a friendly environment when carpooling with others that one may not know. This function is mostly dedicated to benefit those who are carpooling to a further distance.
\newline \newline
The creation of a database will hold all the necessary information for the app to function, making it easily accessible and manageable. The information being stored can range from user information; name, email, phone number, to riding history, to preferences of taxi times, models, or other passengers.

\subsection{Overview}
\label{sub:overview}
% Begin SubSection
This \textbf{SRS} is structured to first give background information about the app. This will include how the app will interface with the taxi companies, along with the general functionalities and assumptions that are being made. The document will then follow with showcasing one of the main business events and its related use cases. This will explain how the main function will work across different scenarios and stakeholders in a visual manner. This will be further expanded upon in more detail throughout the document. It will include more business events with a variety of viewpoints and scenarios for both the function shown in the use case diagram and other main function of the project. This document will conclude by explaining the non-functional requirements involving presentation, performance, usability, security, and maintainability notes of the project.

\subsection{Product Perspective}
\label{sub:product_perspective}
% Begin SubSection

\begin{enumerate}[a)]
	\item The product being developed is an Android application which empowers the ability to book carpool via a user-friendly interface using a taxi company. The application will securely store customer personal information such as carpool request histories, and personal data inputted by the user. The product is not self-contained since its functionality depends heavily on the taxi service provider. There are several out-of-scope concerns such as: driver\textquotesingle s information input (profile, shift, locations, etc.) and payment processing.
	\item The general interaction can be visualized as follows:

\subsection{Constraints}
\label{sub:constraints}
% Begin SubSection
\begin{enumerate}[a)]
	\item \textbf{Geographical}: The app can only operate on the land which the taxi service operate.
	\item \textbf{Technological}: App must be integrated with softwares that the taxi service provider uses.
	\item \textbf{Fare Determination}: Since the app does\textquotesingle t support payment processing directly, the fare has to be determined and processed through the taxi service provider.
	\item \textbf{Data Privacy Regulation}: Data which transmits and stored within the app needs to be processed in a way which complies with the data protection act.

\end{enumerate}

% End SubSection

\subsection{Assumptions and Dependencies}
\label{sub:assumptions_and_dependencies}
% Begin SubSection


\begin{enumerate}[a)]
	\item Assumptions

	\begin{itemize}
		\item Drivers information are provided by the taxi provider (driver profile and shift).
		\item The taxi provider has dedicated API which provide real-time data on driver\textquotesingle s availability.
		\item The taxi provider determines trip prices.
		\item Payment processing is external and not under the scope of the application.

	\end{itemize}

	\item Many problems may occur when the following assumptions failed to hold:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item If trip prices are not determined by the taxi service provider, additional calculations must be performed to find fare fees after each trip.
		\item If drivers data are stored and handled within the context of the app, additional mechanism must be provided for drivers to update their information. In addition, driver\textquotesingle s data storage must comply with the Canadian Data Protection Act. 


	\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
% End SubSection

\subsection{Apportioning of Requirements}
\label{sub:apportioning_of_requirements}
% Begin SubSection

\begin{enumerate}[a)]
	\item \textbf{Technological}: Some specific technilogical requirements (Database type, Integration with taxi provider, etc...) have to be delayed untill the implementation phase.
	\item Non-function Requiremens such as UI,UX, or performance can be finetuned when the app is being implemented or after release.

\subsubsection{Appearance Requirements}
\label{ssub:appearance_requirements}
% Begin SubSubSection
\begin{enumerate}[{LF-A}1. ]
	\item The colour scheme of the application must match the branding colours of the company \\
	{\bf Rationale:} For marketing purposes, the colour scheme within the app need to match the branding colours of the company so the brand becomes well-recognized and there is no confusion among users about the brand.
\end{enumerate}
% End SubSubSection

\subsubsection{Style Requirements}
\label{ssub:style_requirements}
% Begin SubSubSection
\begin{enumerate}[{LF-S}1. ]
	\item The app must have an attractive, responsive UI \\
	{\bf Rationale:} Users are more likely to use and come back to attractive, responsive mobile apps which helps increase the user base and branding power of the app (Johns, 2022). 
	\item The app must have a minimalist design \\
	{\bf Rationale:} Minimalist designed mobile applications have faster loading times, easier navigation within the app, less maintenance and time spent on design/frontend and allow businesses to more clearly give messages to users within the application (UGEM, 2020).
\end{enumerate}

% Begin SubSection

\subsubsection{Ease of Use Requirements}
\label{ssub:ease_of_use_requirements}
% Begin SubSubSection
\begin{enumerate}[{UH-EOU}1. ]
	\item The product must be easy to use for people aged 18 years or older \\
	{\bf Rationale:} The intended audience of this application is adults who need to carpool, so anyone 18 or older must find the app easy to understand and use. People under this age may use the app but most likely their rides would be booked by parents/guardians, so the focus is on this age range.
	\item The user must not encounter any unclear prompts from which they do not know how to proceed \\
	{\bf Rationale:} If the app is prompting the user to do something, that prompt must be clear and easy to understand so it is easy for the user to use the app.
	\item The user must not encounter any errors while using the app, and if they do, what to do next must be clear \\
	{\bf Rationale:} The app must not show the user any errors while they are using it to prevent confusion and to make the app easy to use. On the chance an error does appear to the user, it must be clear on what the user has to do next to remove the error or continue. If the error is generic and confusing to understand, the app is no longer easy to use and leaves the user in confusion.
\end{enumerate}
% End SubSubSection

\subsubsection{Personalization and Internationalization Requirements}
\label{ssub:personalization_and_internationalization_requirements}
% Begin SubSubSection
\begin{enumerate}[{UH-PI}1. ]
	\item The product will operate in both English and French and the user will be able to set their preferred language \\
	{\bf Rationale:} The app will be available only in Canada, so it needs to contain support for both the national languages of Canada and allow the user to choose their preferred language
	\item The product will allow the user to set their preference for dark mode and light mode \\
	{\bf Rationale:} To make the app more personal, users must be able to customize the appearance to their liking. Its important for users to enjoy the appearance of the app so allowing them to personalize dark mode or light mode will help contribute to that.
\end{enumerate}
% End SubSubSection

\subsubsection{Learning Requirements}
\label{ssub:learning_requirements}
% Begin SubSubSection
\begin{enumerate}[{UH-L}1. ]
	\item The product must be able to be used immediately, with no learning curve required to learn how to effectively use the app. \\
	{\bf Rationale:} Mobile apps designed for general users should have no learning curve. Upon using the app for the first time, the app should be designed in such a way that the user immediately knows how to use it. If users take a while to learn how to effectively use the app, they will not come back to it.
\end{enumerate}
% End SubSubSection

\subsubsection{Understandability and Politeness Requirements}
\label{ssub:understandability_and_politeness_requirements}
% Begin SubSubSection
\begin{enumerate}[{UH-UP}1. ]
	\item The product must use symbols and language that are naturally understandable to the general Canadian population \\
	{\bf Rationale:} The app is aimed to be used by anyone in Canada, so the symbols and language used must be understandable by the general Canadian population. Using symbols and language or slang that is specific to a certain group or culture would make the app hard to understand for some of the target users.
\end{enumerate}
% End SubSubSection

\subsubsection{Accessibility Requirements}
\label{ssub:accessibility_requirements}
% Begin SubSubSection
\begin{enumerate}[{UH-A}1. ]
	\item The product must be able to be used by partially sighted users \\
	{\bf Rationale:} A successful mobile app should be accessible to all users, no matter what physical impairments they may face. The app should allow partially sighted or blind users to use the app through their voice or some other means that does not require them to be fully sighted.
	\item The product must provide captions or symbols for audio content to allow users with hearing impairments to access that content. \\
	{\bf Rationale:} A successful mobile app should be accessible to all users, no matter what physical impairments they may face. The app should allow users with hearing impairments to still access any audio content within the app through captions, symbols or some other visual means so they are still able to access the content.
	\item The product must conform to the WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) 2.0 Level AA 
	{\bf Rationale:} The WCAG are a global standard on the accessibility of web based applications. In Ontario, all private organizations with 50 or more employees are required to be WCAG 2.0 AA accessible (Yee). Our company is not yet 50+ people but the hope is to one day get there, so implementing these accessibility features now makes for a smoother transition when the company expands.

\subsection{Performance Requirements}
\label{sub:performance_requirements}
% Begin SubSection

\subsubsection{Speed and Latency Requirements}
\label{ssub:speed_and_latency_requirements}
% Begin SubSubSection
\begin{enumerate}[{PR-SL}1. ]
	\item All responses from the product to the user must be within 50 milliseconds \\
	{\bf Rationale:} The perfect latency is between 20 to 40 milliseconds (Schoenfelder). If all product-to-user responses for our app are 50 milliseconds are better, this is an excellent latency and will bring users back to the app.
\end{enumerate}
% End SubSubSection

\subsubsection{Safety-Critical Requirements}
\label{ssub:safety_critical_requirements}
% Begin SubSubSection
\begin{enumerate}[{PR-SC}1. ]
	\item All taxi services, drivers and other carpoolers will go through a safety check before being allowed to offer rides or join carpools on the app \\
	{\bf Rationale:} Our app connects users with random members of the public, whether that be taxi drivers or fellow carpoolers. To ensure the safety of all users of the app, all drivers and carpoolers will have to go through a safety verification process to verify their intentions and ensure that the safety of the riders is guaranteed.
\end{enumerate}
% End SubSubSection

\subsubsection{Precision or Accuracy Requirements}
\label{ssub:precision_or_accuracy_requirements}
% Begin SubSubSection
\begin{enumerate}[{PR-PA}1. ]
	\item All monetary amounts displayed within the application must be accurate to two decimal places \\
	{\bf Rationale:} Given that this app will involve payments for the taxi rides, all payment amounts will be displayed to two decimal places, which is accurate to the number of dollars and cents for the transaction. For example, ``the total cost of the ride is \$3.40'' \\
	\item All times must be displayed in the form HH:MM PM/AM where HH is between 01 and 12. \\
	{\bf Rationale:} The app may show estimated time of arrival, which will be shown using the HH:MM format, showing only the hours and minutes and not anything more. If the app showed seconds or below it would be inaccurate and confusing for users. For example, ``the estimated time of arrival is 10:04 PM'' \\
	\item All distance measurements must be accurate to one decimal place. \\
	{\bf Rationale:} The app may show distance to a destination or how far the driver is from picking you up. These should be shown with one decimal place as more decimal places would make it harder to understand and would make it lose meaning. For example, ``your driver is 3.2 km away''
\end{enumerate}
% End SubSubSection

\subsubsection{Reliability and Availability Requirements}
\label{ssub:reliability_and_availability_requirements}
% Begin SubSubSection
\begin{enumerate}[{PR-RA}1. ]
	\item The product must be available for use 24 hours per day, 365 days per year \\
	{\bf Rationale:} An app that allows users to book carpool rides should be available 24/7, 365 days a year because users should be able to book a carpool at any time of the day on any day of the year.
	\item The product must perform without failure in 98\% of use cases \\
	{\bf Rationale:} Failures are expected to occur in any software application, but if the app performs without failure for the majority of uses then it can be deemed to be a reliable application that only fails on the rare occasion
	\item The mean time to restore the product following a failure must not be greater than 10 minutes \\
	{\bf Rationale:} When the product does fail, it should recover and become usable again within 10 minutes max, otherwise users will begin to question the reliability and usage of the app.
\end{enumerate}
% End SubSubSection

\subsubsection{Robustness or Fault-Tolerance Requirements}
\label{ssub:robustness_or_fault_tolerance_requirements}
% Begin SubSubSection
\begin{enumerate}[{PR-RFT}1. ]
	\item The product must continue to be usable if external services it relies on go down.\\
	{\bf Rationale:} The app will rely on some external third party services, and it needs to be tolerant to faults in those systems. For example, if the app interfaces with an API from the taxi service and that API goes down, the app needs to continue to be usable. If an AWS region goes down and the app uses AWS cloud services, it must change to another region to ensure it continues to be usable.
\end{enumerate}
% End SubSubSection

\subsubsection{Capacity Requirements}
\label{ssub:capacity_requirements}
% Begin SubSubSection
\begin{enumerate}[{PR-C}1. ]
	\item The product must be able to handle up to 10000 users simultaneously at any given time \\
	{\bf Rationale:} Although the app will not start with 10000 concurrent users right away, 10000 is a good estimate as to how many concurrent users the app may have within a few years of business. Given that Uber, a similar ride sharing application has millions of concurrent users, 10000 is a realistic capacity limit for this app.
\end{enumerate}
% End SubSubSection

\subsubsection{Scalability or Extensibility Requirements}
\label{ssub:scalability_or_extensibility_requirements}
% Begin SubSubSection
\begin{enumerate}[{PR-SE}1. ]
	\item The product must be able to handle any increases to the number of concurrent users \\
	{\bf Rationale:} In a previous requirement it was defined that the product should be able to handle 10000 concurrent users. Once the app scales, it should be able to handle increases to this value. Popular ride sharing app Uber serves millions of concurrent requests, so this app should be able to scale to these values as well.

\label{ssub:integrity_requirements}
% Begin SubSubSection
\begin{enumerate}[{SR-INT}1. ]
	\item The system must be secure against outside threats that look to access/change the data \\
	{\bf Rationale:} All software systems come with the threat of external hackers. We must ensure that the system is secure and cannot be hacked, otherwise data can be changed and it will no longer be consistent, violating data integrity 
	\item All data input into the database will be automated where possible \\
	{\bf Rationale:} A big cause of data inconsistency in software applications is manual input. It is much easier for a human to make a mistake while manually inputting data than it is for an automated process to input data to the database. To maintain integrity of the data, the system should eliminate the risk of manual data input mistakes as much as possible.
